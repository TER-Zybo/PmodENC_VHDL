2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) leds[0] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (leds[0]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#2 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) leds[1] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (leds[1]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#3 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) leds[2] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (leds[2]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#4 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) leds[3] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (leds[3]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on pmod[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on pmod[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on pmod[2] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on pmod[3] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on leds[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on leds[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on leds[2] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on leds[3] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>
